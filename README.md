# Hospitality Domain Dashboard - Using Power BI

## Overview
This Power BI project presents interactive dashboards analyzing key metrics across multiple hotel properties under Atliq. The dashboards include detailed reports on revenue, occupancy rates, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and customer ratings, segmented by property and city. Weekly data tracking provides insights into performance trends, room utilization, and platform efficiency, aiding in optimizing hotel operations and decision-making.

## About this Dataset
The dataset includes five CSV files covering dates, hotels, rooms, aggregated bookings, and individual bookings. Key columns provide insights into room categories, booking details, guest counts, revenues, and ratings, supporting a comprehensive analysis of hotel operations and customer behavior.

In this project, data was initially loaded from Excel files into Power BI. I used Power Query to clean the data by removing duplicates, fixing missing values, and formatting columns. Relationships were then established between the tables to enable comprehensive analysis. A table called `Key Measures` was created to calculate important metrics and provide actionable insights.
